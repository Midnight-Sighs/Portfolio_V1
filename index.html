            <p>Hello and welcome to my software development portfolio page.  Here you will find the projects that I've done and my personal notes about them, including what they taught me.</p>
            <p>All images on this page and used to create it are from Unsplash and have been edited by me to be the colors and dimensions I want them to be.</p>
            <p>While I am a jack of all trades, this page will be focused on my software development journey.  Links to anything else will be in my "about me" section.  </p>

            <h1>About Midnight</h1>
            <p>Although I said this page was for my software development, I am much more than that. I am a jack-of-all-trades artist, a gamer (table-top and digital), and a mom of two boys.  I am diverse and fun and I truly believe that we have to make our moments fun and I try to bring fun into things any way that I can, even if it's small.</p>
            <p>I go by Midnight because I hate my real name (it's Sierra, for anyone who truly wants to use it) because I feel like it's never suited me.  In the art world, I've also gone by the alias of Arreis-Kurai.</p>
            <p>Since you're taking the time to read about me, I may as well reward you (tempt you?) with options to get to know me even better so I'll add my linkTree, where you can find the homes of my traditional art, my miniature painting, my Etsy life, and more.</p>
